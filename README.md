# Arabic-Fatwa-ChatBot
In this project, I created an Arabic Fatwa ChatBot that aims to answer a different question 

### 2.1 Scraping the Data
The data scraping was one of the most time consuming parts of this project because itâ€™s difficult to navigate through the nested tables (the HTML). However, BeautifulSoup made it quite simple to grab the HTML and parse through it.

In this project I scraped from [islamweb.net](https://www.islamweb.net/ar/), I decided to start by scraping top of all  Fatwa  so that I could build out my chatbot. When I looked at the [page](https://www.islamweb.net/ar/fatawa) that includes all fatwas. As a first step, I noticed that I need to collect all linkes of all fatwas then  go into each fatwa to collect the needed information (Question and answer). 

### 2.2 Data Cleaning

The next focus was to clean the data to build a better chatbot. I started by importing the CSV file that I had created into my Python environment then I read this file using dataframes.Next, I worked with the variables to make sure that they were able to be processed by applied the following: 

* Remove duplicated fatwa
* Remove special charecter 
* Remove number and stop words
* Remove harakat 
* Stemming
* Shuffling Data

### 2.3 Building the Arabic chatbot
I used buildin library
